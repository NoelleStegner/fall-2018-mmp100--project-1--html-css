<h2> MY REAMING GALLERY </h2>
</div>

<p>“To dream avant-garde is to dream radically, without limitations of the mind, to imagine what has not been seen and dwell in the presence of nouveau.
  As an acknowledgment to those innovators, who were also dreamers of an American identity and country to call their own, the artists in this exhibition display a survey of ideas,
  intention and materials that invoke the legacy and culture of Harlem. In reflection of the Harlem Renaissance, the participating artists will present works engaging with
  the theme to dream avant-garde.”
</p>
<p> - Alteronce Gumby, Curator (1987)
